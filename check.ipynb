This reigns true in terms of design and even their promotional materials. But that is a good thing though, because this phone also features Realme’s ArmorShell protection. It is a combination of multiple things like metal build and frame, reinforced glass, coated protection film, shock-absorbing internals, silicone strips and foams, etc. All this adds to the durability of the phone and as a result, it is TÜV Rheinland certified for high reliability. It also comes with IP54 water and dust resistance.\\nOn the front, the phone has a 6.74-inch display with HD+ resolution. The company shies away from mentioning the panel type of the Realme Narzo N61. This leads us to believe that it is a TFT LCD, which is a cheaper panel option commonly seen in this price range. Other than that, the screen is capable of a 90Hz refresh rate, a 180Hz touch sampling rate, and a peak brightness of up to 560 nits.  \\n### Performance and Software  \\nThe primary driver on the Realme Narzo N61 is the UNISOC T612 chipset. It is a relatively low-powered silicon that comes in a 12nm fabrication. Furthermore, the processor has eight cores, clocks in at 1.8 GHz, and scores over 250,000 on AnTuTu. Meanwhile, the phone is available in two configurations: 4GB + 64GB, and 6GB + 128GB. It also allows you to expand the memory and storage by up to 6GB and 2TB via software and MicroSD card respectively.\\nIn terms of software, the phone boots on the Realme UI based on Android 14. The company ensures that it will offer a lag-free experience for four years. The Realme Narzo N61 also comes with AI Boost Engine that smoothens the performance and improves the frame rate during demanding activities like gaming and multitasking. It also comes with Mini Capsule 2.0 which is Apple’s Dynamic Island knock-off and Rainwater Smart Touch that improves touch recognition even when your hands or screen is wet.  \\n### Camera and the rest  \\nOptics-wise, you get a 32MP primary shooter and a 5MP selfie camera. There is also an auxiliary lens on the back. However, its purpose has not been stated. It is likely a dummy unit just for show. In the tank, the Realme Narzo N61 packs a 5,000 mAh battery that supports moderate 10W charging. For wireless connectivity, it has dual SIM, 4G LTE, dual-band WiFi, and Bluetooth v5.0. On the other hand, for wired connections, the phone has a USB Type-C port as well as a 3.5mm headphone jack.\\nRealme Narzo N61 Price in Nepal\\nVariant\\nPrice\\nRealme Narzo N61 | Rs. 13,499  \\n###  \\nSpecifications\\nBODY\\nDimension\\n167.3 x 76.7 x 7.8 mm (6.59 x 3.02 x 0.31 in)\\nWeight\\n187 g (6.60 oz)\\nSIM\\nDual SIM (Nano-SIM, dual stand-by)\\nBuild\\nGlass front, plastic frame, plastic back\\nColors\\nVoyage Blue, Marble Black\\nDISPLAY\\nType\\nIPS LCD, 90Hz, 450 nits (typ), 560 nits (HBM)\\nSize\\n6.74 inches, 109.7 cm2 (~85.5% screen-to-body ratio)\\nResolution\\n720 x 1600 pixels, 20:9 ratio (~260 ppi density)\\nProtection\\nReinforced glass, IP54, dust and splash resistant\\nPERFORMANCE\\nOS\\nAndroid 14, Realme UI 5.0\\nChipset\\nUnisoc Tiger T612 (12 nm)\\nGPU\\nMali-G57\\nCPU\\nOcta-core (2x1.8 GHz Cortex-A75 & 6x1.8 GHz Cortex-A55)\\nMEMORY\\nCard Slot\\nmicroSDXC (dedicated slot)\\nInternal\\n64GB 4GB RAM\\nBACK CAMERA\\nSingle\\n32 MP, f/1.8, (wide), PDAF Auxiliary lens\\nFeatures\\nLED flash, panorama\\nVideo\\n1080p@30fps\\nFRONT CAMERA\\nSingle\\n5 MP, (wide)\\nVideo\\nYes\\nSOUND\\nLoudspeaker\\nYes\\n3.5mm jack\\nYes\\nCONNECTIVITY\\nWLAN\\nWi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, dual-band\\nBluetooth\\n5.0, A2DP, LE\\nPositioning\\nGPS, GALILEO, GLONASS, BDS\\nNFC\\nNo\\nRadio\\nUnspecified\\nUSB\\nUSB Type-C 2.0\\nFEATURES\\nSensors\\nFingerprint (side-mounted), accelerometer, proximity, compass\\nBATTERY\\nType\\n5000 mAh, non-removable\\nCharging\\n10W wired\\nSECURITY\\nFace Unlock\\nFace Unlock\\nFingerprint\\nSide-mounted fingerprint sensor  \\nURL: https://hukut.com/realme-narzo-n61-price-in-nepal  \\n-----End of Product-----'),\n",

Powered by a capable processor and backed by ample RAM and storage, it delivers smooth multitasking and ample space for apps and media. The device boasts a vibrant display that brings content to life, while the long-lasting battery ensures you stay connected throughout the day. The Y19s also captures impressive photos and videos, thanks to its versatile camera setup.  \\n### Design and Display  \\nIt is more accurate to refer to it as a follow-up to the Y17s, despite the name giving the impression that it is associated with the Y19. Therefore, in terms of design, the phone is sleek, with rounded corners, and seems to have a matte or slightly shimmering finish. Additionally, the phone features two rear cameras that are positioned vertically in an oval-shaped camera module.\\nThis smartphone features a 6.68\" LCD panel on the front that has a refresh rate of 90 Hz and a maximum brightness of 1000 nits. It also has an IP64 rating, which makes it dust-tight and provides rudimentary water protection, and a drop-resistant design.  \\n### Performance  \\nThe Vivo Y19s\\' internal components include a Mali-G57 GPU and a Unisoc T612 chipset, which is based on a 12nm technology and has two Cortex-A75 cores and six A55 cores operating at 1.8GHz.\\nAdditionally, this processor comes with 128 GB of eMMC 5.1 storage and up to 6GB of LPDDR4X RAM. The card tray can hold two nano-SIMs and a microSD, which is a plus, even though none of that is particularly intriguing.\\nFor a phone of this small, the Vivo Y19s\\' remarkable 5,500mAh battery is amazing. The battery charges at a modest 15W, though. It should survive for a long time even after four years of use if you charge it once a day, as it is rated to retain at least 80% of its original capacity after 1,460 cycles.  \\n### Camera and the rest  \\nRegarding the camera, it has a 50MP sensor on the back. The selfie camera, which has a 5MP resolution, is located inside a punch hole.

The camera cutout has grown larger, while the back panel has gone back to being curved. Similarly, the camera island has gone a bit softer with the edge and the LED flash has shifted a coupled millimetres up. The phone offers an added level of durability with an IP64 rating, reinforced internal design, and Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection.\\nOn the front, it has a 6.67-inch OLED screen with FHD+ resolution. It offers a refresh rate of up to 120Hz and a peak brightness of 2,100 nits. You also get a standard and instantaneous touch sampling rate of 240Hz and 2,160Hz respectively. The display is capable of HDR10+ and covers the DCI-P3 color gamut. Moreover, it has received TÜV and SGS certifications for eye care features like low blue light.  \\n### Performance  \\nThe MediaTek Dimensity 7025 Ultra serves as the brain of the Redmi Note 14 5G. With 6nm fabrication and a higher 2.5GHz clock speed, this chipset offers a decent upgrade over the Dimensity 6080 on its predecessor. Furthermore, the chip is paired with up to 12 GB of RAM and 512GB of UFS 2.2 storage. However only the 8/128GB and 8/256GB are likely to launch in Nepal For battery, it has a sizable 5,110 mAh cell with 45W charging support.  \\n### Camera and the rest  \\nThe primary shooter on the Redmi Note 14 5G is a 108MP OIS-enabled lens coupled with a Sony LYT-600 sensor. Additionally, there is an 8MP ultrawide unit and a 2MP macro sensor. The latter barely adds to the photography experience though. Meanwhile, a 20MP camera sits on the front for selfies and 2D face scanning.\\nConnectivity-wise, you get dual-SIM support with 5G cellular, dual-band WiFi 5, and Bluetooth v5.3 for wireless medium. On the other hand, a USB Type-C port and a 3.5mm headphone jack handle the wired connections. For additional security, there is an in-display fingerprint sensor. The company also mentions “Heart rate detection” as a feature on this phone, but refuses to elaborate any further.\\nRedmi Note 14 5G Price in Nepal\\nVariant\\nPrice\\n8/256GB | Rs. 30,999\\n8/256GB | Rs. 30,999\\n12/512GB | Rs. 35,999  \\n###  \\nSpecifications\\nBODY\\nDimension\\n162.40 mm x 75.70 mm x 7.99 mm\\nWeight\\n190g\\nBuild\\nGlass front (Gorilla Glass 5), plastic back\\nSIM\\nNano-SIM + Nano-SIM IP64, dust and water resistant\\nColors\\nMidnight Black, Coral Green, Lavender Purple\\nDISPLAY\\nType\\nAMOLED, 120Hz, 2100 nits (peak)\\nSize\\n6.67 inches, 107.4 cm2 (~87.4% screen-to-body ratio)\\nResolution\\n1080 x 2400 pixels, 20:9 ratio (~395 ppi density)\\nProtection\\nCorning Gorilla Glass 5 Always-on display\\nPERFORMANCE\\nOS\\nAndroid 14, HyperOS\\nChipset\\nMediatek Dimensity 7025 Ultra (6 nm)\\nCPU\\nOcta-core (2x2.5 GHz Cortex-A78 & 6x2.0 GHz Cortex-A55)\\nGPU\\nIMG BXM-8-256\\nMEMORY\\nCard Slot\\nmicroSDXC (uses shared SIM slot)\\nInternal\\n128GB 6GB RAM, 256GB 8GB RAM\\nBACK CAMERA\\nTriple\\n108 MP, f/1.7, (wide), 1/1.67\", 0.64µm, PDAF, OIS 8 MP, f/2.2, (ultrawide) 2 MP, f/2.4, (macro)\\nFeatures\\nLED flash, HDR, panorama\\nVideo\\n1080p@30fps, gyro-EIS, OIS\\nFRONT CAMERA\\nSingle\\n20 MP, f/2.2, (wide), 1/4.0\", 0.7µm\\nVideo\\n1080p@30fps, gyro-EIS\\nSOUND\\nLoudspeaker\\nYes, with dual speakers\\n3.5mm jack\\nYes 24-bit/192kHz Hi-Res audio\\nCONNECTIVITY\\nWLAN\\nWi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, dual-band, Wi-Fi Direct\\nBluetooth\\n5.3, A2DP, LE\\nPositioning\\nGPS, GLONASS, BDS, GALILEO\\nNFC\\nYes (market/region dependent)\\nInfrared port\\nYes\\nRadio\\nFM radio\\nUSB\\nUSB Type-C 2.0, OTG\\nBATTERY\\nType\\n5110 mAh\\nCharging\\n45W wired\\nFEATURES\\nSensors\\nFingerprint (under display, optical), accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass\\nNETWORK\\nTechnology\\nGSM / HSPA / LTE / 5G\\n2G bands\\nGSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900\\n3G bands\\nHSDPA 800 / 850 / 900 / 1700(AWS) / 1900 / 2100\\n4G bands\\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 26, 28, 32, 38, 40, 41, 42, 48, 66\\n5G bands\\n1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 12, 20, 26, 28, 38, 40, 41, 48, 66, 77, 78 SA/NSA\\nSpeed\\nHSPA, LTE, 5G  \\nURL: https://hukut.com/xiaomi-redmi-note-14-5g  \\n-----End of Product-----'),\n",

It is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 6300 chipset, paired with up to 12GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage. The phone includes a dual rear camera setup with a 50MP main sensor and a 2MP secondary lens, along with a 16MP front camera. It runs on Android 15, has a 6000mAh battery with 45W fast charging support, and skips both the headphone jack and NFC.  \\n### Performance  \\nInstead of going with a high-end chip, Realme chose the MediaTek Dimensity 6300, and honestly, that was a smart move for this phone’s purpose. Whether it’s social scrolling, YouTube, messaging, or light gaming, things move smoothly without overheating or draining the battery too fast. It runs Android 15 with Realme UI 6.0, and the software feels clean nothing bloated or sluggish. You get up to 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, which is more than enough for most people.  \\n### Battery  \\nThere’s a 6000mAh battery inside, and that’s where the 14T quietly shines. You can go a full day and a half, maybe even two, on a single charge if you\\'re not constantly gaming or streaming. It supports 45W wired charging, and gets to about 50% in half an hour quick enough for most daily routines. There’s no wireless charging, but it does support bypass charging, which is useful when you\\'re plugged in for a longer gaming session.  \\n### Display  \\nThe 6.67-inch AMOLED display is actually one of the highlights here. It’s bright (up to 2100 nits), smooth thanks to the 120Hz refresh rate, and has slim bezels that make it feel more immersive than you’d expect at this price. Whether you\\'re binge-watching or just checking the news, the screen stays sharp and easy on the eyes. Colors are vibrant, but not oversaturated it strikes a nice balance.  \\n### Camera  \\nOn the back, the Realme 14T has a 50MP main camera, paired with a very basic 2MP sensor. It’s not trying to replace a DSLR, but it does its job well for everyday shots good light, decent detail, and not much fuss. Video maxes out at 1080p@60fps, and while there\\'s no 4K, it has gyro-EIS, which helps with shaky hands. The 16MP selfie camera is clean and simple, perfect for video calls and social posts.  \\n### Sound & Connectivity  \\nThere are stereo speakers that are loud enough for casual media and calls, and while there’s no headphone jack, wireless audio works well via Bluetooth 5.3. It also supports 24-bit/192kHz Hi-Res audio, which audiophiles might appreciate. Connectivity-wise, it checks most boxes with 5G, Wi-Fi ac, and solid GPS coverage. No NFC here, and no FM radio either, but it’s otherwise well-equipped for daily use.\\nRealme 14T 5G Price in Nepal\\nVariant\\nPrice\\n8/256GB | Rs. 36,999  \\n###  \\nSpecifications\\nBODY\\nDimension\\n163.2 x 75.7 x 8 mm (6.43 x 2.98 x 0.31 in)\\nWeight\\n196 g (6.91 oz)\\nBuild\\nGlass front, plastic back IP68/IP69 dust tight and water resistant (high pressure water jets; immersible up to 2.5m for 30 min)\\nColors\\nSurf Green, Obsidian Black, Lightning Purple\\nDISPLAY\\nType\\nAMOLED, 120Hz, 2100 nits (peak)\\nSize\\n6.67 inches, 112.5 cm2 (~91.0% screen-to-body ratio)\\nResolution\\n1080 x 2400 pixels, 20:9 ratio (~386 ppi density)\\nPERFORMANCE\\nOS\\nAndroid 15, Realme UI 6.0\\nChipset\\nMediatek Dimensity 6300 (6 nm)\\nCPU\\nOcta-core (2x2.4 GHz Cortex-A76 & 6x2.0 GHz Cortex-A55)\\nGPU\\nMali-G57 MC2\\nMEMORY\\nCard Slot\\nNo\\nInternal\\n256GB 8GB RAM\\nBACK CAMERA\\nDual\\n50 MP, f/1.8, 27mm (wide), 1/2.88\", PDAF 2 MP, f/2.4\\nFeatures\\nLED flash, HDR, panorama\\nVideo\\n1080p@30/60, gyro-EIS\\nFRONT CAMERA\\nSingle\\n16 MP, f/2.4, 23mm (wide), 1/3.09\"\\nVideo\\n1080p@30fps\\nSOUND\\nLoudspeaker\\nYes, with stereo speakers\\n3.5mm jack\\nNo 24-bit/192kHz Hi-Res audio\\nCONNECTIVITY\\nWLAN\\nWi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, dual-band\\nBluetooth\\n5.3, A2DP, LE\\nPositioning\\nGPS, GLONASS, GALILEO, BDS, QZSS\\nNFC\\nNo\\nRadio\\nNo\\nUSB\\nUSB Type-C\\nFEATURES\\nSensors\\nFingerprint (under display, optical), accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass\\nBATTERY\\nType\\n6000 mAh\\nCharging\\n45W wired, 50% in 30 min\\nNetwork\\nTechnology\\nGSM / HSPA / LTE / 5G\\n2G band\\nGSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900\\n3G band\\nHSDPA 850 / 900 / 2100\\n4G band\\n1, 3, 5, 8, 28, 40, 41\\n5G band\\n1, 3, 5, 8, 28, 40, 41, 77, 78 SA/NSA\\nSpeed\\nHSPA, LTE, 5G  \\nURL: https://hukut.com/realme-14t-5g  \\n-----End of Product-----'),\n",

That’s the vibe CMF is going for with the CMF Phone 2 Pro, a smartphone that offers a pleasantly personalized alternative to the typical glass slabs. Much like its predecessor, this phone comes with a user-replaceable back cover which you can unscrew and swap out in minutes. It’s a modular touch you don’t often see, especially in this price range.\\nThe design also packs subtle durability perks. It carries an IP54 rating and can survive water splashes and even shallow dips (up to 25cm for 20 minutes), according to the manufacturer. CMF is shipping the Phone 2 Pro in four colors in Nepal: White, Black, Orange, and Light Green.\\nFlip it over, and you’re greeted with a massive 6.77-inch AMOLED display. It’s bright peaking at a crazy 3000 nits and supports HDR10+ and Ultra HDR, making it great for watching vivid, contrast-heavy content. With 120Hz refresh rate and 1 billion colors, this panel isn’t just smooth; it’s gorgeous.  \\n### Performance  \\nAt the core of the Phone 2 Pro is the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Pro chip, built on a power-efficient 4nm process. The CPU here includes four high-performance Cortex-A78 cores, and it’s paired with a Mali-G615 MC2 GPU for graphics.\\nThis setup is backed by 8GB of RAM and up to 256GB of internal storage, with the bonus of microSD card support. The phone boots on Android 15 right out of the box, topped with Nothing OS 3.2. CMF is promising 3 major Android updates, which is reassuring in a world where midrange phones often get left behind.  \\n### Camera  \\nThis is where the Phone 2 Pro really turns up the heat. On the back, you get a triple camera system featuring a 50MP main sensor, a 50MP telephoto lens with 2x optical zoom, and an 8MP ultrawide shooter. That’s a solid, versatile combo for a phone in this segment.\\nFor video lovers, it supports 4K recording at 30fps, and there’s gyro-EIS for steadier shots. Up front, a 16MP selfie camera gets the job done for video calls and social media snaps with 1080p video support.  \\n### Battery and Charging  \\nKeeping the lights on is a 5000mAh battery, which should comfortably last a full day. It supports 33W wired charging and also comes with 5W reverse wired charging, letting you top up accessories like earbuds on the go.\\nConnectivity-wise, you get the usual suspects: 5G, WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, and NFC (depending on the region). And yes, there’s a USB Type-C port, but no headphone jack you probably saw that coming.\\nNothing CMF Phone 2 Pro Price in Nepal\\nVariant\\nPrice\\n8/128GB | Without Charger | Rs. 34,999\\n8/128GB | Charger included inside the box | Rs. 35,999\\nWithout Charger | 8/256GB | Rs. 39,499\\nCharger included inside the box | 8/256GB | Rs. 40,499  \\n###  \\nSpecifications\\nBODY\\nDimension\\n164 x 78 x 7.8 mm (6.46 x 3.07 x 0.31 in)\\nWeight\\n185 g (6.53 oz)\\nBuild\\nUser-replaceable back cover IP54 dust protected and water resistant (water splashes) Manufacturer-rated water-resistant (up to 25cm for 20 min)\\nColors\\nWhite, Black, Orange, Light Green\\nDISPLAY\\nType\\nAMOLED, 1B colors, 120Hz, HDR10+, 800 nits (typ), 1300 nits (HBM), 3000 nits (peak)\\nSize\\n6.77 inches, 110.9 cm2 (~86.7% screen-to-body ratio)\\nResolution\\n1080 x 2392 pixels (~388 ppi density)\\nProtection\\nPanda Glass Always-on display Ultra HDR image support\\nPERFORMANCE\\nOS\\nAndroid 15, up to 3 major Android upgrades, Nothing OS 3.2\\nChipset\\nMediatek Dimensity 7300 Pro (4 nm)\\nCPU\\nOcta-core (4x2.5 GHz Cortex-A78 & 4x2.0 GHz Cortex-A55)\\nGPU\\nMali-G615 MC2\\nMEMORY\\nCard Slot\\nmicroSDXC\\nInternal\\n128GB 8GB RAM, 256GB 8GB RAM\\nBACK CAMERA\\nFeatures\\nLED flash, panorama, HDR\\nVideo\\n4K@30fps, 1080p@30/60/120fps, gyro-EIS\\nTriple\\n50 MP, f/1.9, 24mm (wide), 1/1.57\", 1.0µm, dual pixel PDAF 50 MP, f/1.9, 50mm (telephoto), 1/2.88\", PDAF, 2x optical zoom 8 MP, f/2.2, 15mm, 120˚ (ultrawide), 1/4.0\", 1.12µm\\nFRONT CAMERA\\nSingle\\n16 MP, f/2.0, 22mm (wide), 1/3.0\"\\nVideo\\n1080p@30fps\\nSOUND\\nLoudspeaker\\nYes\\n3.5mm jack\\nNo\\nCONNECTIVITY\\nWLAN\\nWi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/6, dual-band\\nBluetooth\\n5.3, A2DP, LE\\nPositioning\\nGPS, GALILEO, GLONASS, BDS, QZSS\\nNFC\\nmarket/region dependent\\nRadio\\nNo\\nUSB\\nUSB Type-C\\nFEATURES\\nSensors\\nFingerprint (under display, optical), accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass\\nBATTERY\\nType\\n5000 mAh\\nCharging\\n33W wired 5W reverse wired\\nNETWORK\\nTechnology\\nGSM / HSPA / LTE / 5G\\n2G bands\\nGSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900\\n3G bands\\nHSDPA 800 / 850 / 900 / 1700(AWS) / 1900 / 2100\\n4G bands\\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 17, 18, 19, 26, 20, 28, 38, 40, 41, 42, 48, 66, 71 - International\\n5G bands\\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 17, 18, 19, 26, 20, 28, 38, 40, 41, 42, 48, 66, 71 SA/NSA - International\\nSpeed\\nHSPA, LTE, 5G  \\nURL: https://hukut.com/nothing-cmf-phone-2-pro  \\n-----End of Product-----'),\n",

Its flat frame and slim body make it easy to hold, while the back design gives off an iPhone-like vibe thanks to its rectangular camera module. The phone weighs just 171 grams and measures only 7.29mm thick, making it super comfortable to use daily. It comes in two stylish color options in Nepal—Mars Green and Velvet Gray. Up front, you get a 6.7-inch AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and a resolution of 2412 x 1080 pixels. What really stands out is the peak HDR brightness of 3,500 nits, which makes the screen easy to view even under bright sunlight.The phone has an IP65 rating, so it\\'s splash-resistant—good for everyday use but not for full underwater dives. That said, Honor says you can take photos underwater, and it can reportedly survive drops from up to 6 feet. For security, there’s an in-display fingerprint scanner, and the display is certified by TÜV Rheinland and SGS, which means less eye strain from flickering during long use.\\n**Decent Performance and All-Day Battery**\\nPerformance-wise, the Honor 400 Lite is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7025-Ultra processor. It features Cortex A78 cores at 2.5GHz, which should be more than enough for daily use, social media, and even some gaming. On the graphics side, it uses the IMG BXM-8-256 GPU, which handles casual games well. The phone comes with 8GB or 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, giving you enough space for apps, videos, and photos. It runs on MagicOS 9.0, based on Android 15, though software support duration hasn’t been confirmed yet. Powering everything is a 5230mAh battery, backed by 35W fast charging, which should easily last through a full day of use.\\n**Sharp Cameras and Smart AI Features**\\nOn the camera front, the Honor 400 Lite features a 108MP main sensor with 3x lossless zoom and an f/1.75 aperture, promising sharp and clear photos in daylight. It also includes a 5MP ultrawide lens that can also act as a depth sensor. A cool extra is the AI camera button below the power key, which can instantly launch the camera, take photos or videos, zoom in, and even search for objects when held down. With its mix of smart features and clean design, the Honor 400 Lite offers great value for buyers in Nepal looking for a stylish and capable mid-range smartphone.\\nHonor 400 lite Price in Nepal\\nVariant\\nPrice\\n12/256GB | Rs. 39,999  \\n###  \\nSpecifications\\nBODY\\nDimension\\n161 x 74.6 x 7.3 mm (6.34 x 2.94 x 0.29 in)\\nWeight\\n171 g\\nSIM\\nNano-SIM + Nano-SIM + eSIM (max 2 at a time) IP65 dust tight and water resistant (low pressure water jets)\\nColors\\nMarrs Green, Velvet Grey\\nDISPLAY\\nType\\nAMOLED, 120Hz, 3500 nits (peak)\\nSize\\n6.7 inches, 108.0 cm2 (~89.9% screen-to-body ratio)\\nResolution\\n1080 x 2412 pixels, 20:9 ratio (~394 ppi density)\\nPERFORMANCE\\nOS\\nAndroid 15, up to 6 major Android upgrades, MagicOS 9\\nChipset\\nMediatek Dimensity 7025 Ultra (6 nm)\\nCPU\\nOcta-core (2x2.5 GHz Cortex-A78 & 6x2.0 GHz Cortex-A55)\\nGPU\\nIMG BXM-8-256\\nMEMORY\\nCard Slot\\nNo\\nInternal\\n256GB 12GB RAM\\nBACK CAMERA\\nDual\\n108 MP, f/1.8, (wide), 1/1.67\", PDAF 5 MP, f/2.2, (ultrawide)\\nFeatures\\nLED flash, HDR, panorama\\nVideo\\n1080p@30fps\\nFRONT CAMERA\\nDual\\n16 MP, f/2.5, (wide)\\nVideo\\n1080p@30fps\\nSOUND\\nLoudspeaker\\nYes\\n3.5mm jack\\nNo\\nCONNECTIVITY\\nWLAN\\nWi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, dual-band, Wi-Fi Direct\\nBluetooth\\n5.3, A2DP, LE\\nPositioning\\nGPS, GLONASS, GALILEO, BDS\\nNFC\\nYes (market/region dependent)\\nRadio\\nUnspecified\\nUSB\\nUSB Type-C 2.0, OTG\\nFEATURES\\nSensors\\nFingerprint (under display, optical), accelerometer, compass, proximity (ultrasonic)\\nBATTERY\\nType\\nLi-Po 5230 mAh\\nCharging\\n35W wired\\nNETWORK\\nTechnology\\nGSM / HSPA / LTE / 5G\\n2G bands\\nGSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900\\n3G bands\\nHSDPA 850 / 900 / 1900 / 2100\\n4G bands\\nLTE\\n5G bands\\nSA/NSA\\nSpeed\\nHSPA, LTE, 5G  \\nURL: https://hukut.com/honor-400-lite  \\n-----End of Product-----'),\n",

Paired with 8 GB RAM (expandable to 12 GB via memory fusion) and fast UFS 4.0 storage, apps pop open in a blink. XOS 15 on Android 15 feels lighter than past Infinix skins, and the dual-shoulder GT triggers give you console-style taps with almost zero input lag and handy for clutch matches on Nepali servers.\\n**Design and Display**\\nAt first glance the 6.78-inch LTPS AMOLED steals the show: 144 Hz refresh keeps animations liquid-smooth, while 2000-nit peak brightness stays legible even under Pokhara’s midday sun. Gorilla Glass 7i fronts the panel, and a neat RGB strip on the back adds gamer flair without looking kitsch. You can pick from Blade White, Shadow Ash, or Dark Flare finishes; all three hide fingerprints better than you’d think. The squared-off frame sits comfortably in one hand, and IP64 sealing shrugs off dust on Himalayan trails.\\n**Camera**\\nA 108 MP main shooter snaps crisp daylight photos with plenty of detail for Instagram Reels, while the 8 MP ultrawide widens the scene for group shots at Pashupatinath or sunset landscapes in Sarangkot. Selfie duties fall to a 13 MP front cam that handles skin tones well and supports 4K video. Night mode is decent, pulling in enough light without turning everything into a watercolor painting.\\n**Battery, Charging & Extras**\\nThe 5550 mAh cell (5200 mAh in some markets) easily powers a full day of heavy use think 7-plus hours of screen-on time. When you’re low, 45 W wired or 30 W wireless top-ups get you back to 50 % in roughly half an hour, and bypass charging keeps temps down during marathon gaming. Infinix even bundles a MagCharge Cooler that clips on magnetically and drops temps by about 30 %. Toss in stereo speakers, an in-display fingerprint reader, and 0 % EMI deals at hukut store, and you get a feature-packed mid-ranger.\\n**Who It’s For / Ideal Use**\\nIf you’re looking for the “best gaming phone under 50,000 in Nepal” that can double as a daily driver, the Infinix GT 30 Pro nails the brief. It suits students who live on Mobile Legends, creators who need a bright panel for color-accurate edits, and road warriors who hate hunting for chargers. In short, anyone wanting flagship-style extras on a mid-tier budget should keep this handset on their radar.\\nInfinix GT 30 Pro Price in Nepal\\nVariant\\nPrice\\n8/256GB | without cooler | Rs. 47,999\\nWith Cooler | 8/256GB | Rs. 49,999  \\n###  \\nSpecifications\\nBODY\\nDimension\\n163.7 x 75.8 x 8 mm (6.44 x 2.98 x 0.31 in)\\nWeight\\n189 g\\nBuild\\nGlass front, plastic frame, plastic back\\nSIM\\nNano-SIM + Nano-SIM IP64 dust tight and water resistant (water splashes) Customizable RGB LEDs on the back Pressure sensitive zones (Gaming triggers)\\nColors\\nDark Flare, Blade White, Shadow Ash\\nDISPLAY\\nType\\nAMOLED, 1B colors, 144Hz, 2304Hz PWM, 700 nits (typ), 1600 nits (peak), 4500 nits (peak)\\nSize\\n6.78 inches, 111.0 cm2 (~89.4% screen-to-body ratio)\\nResolution\\n1224 x 2720 pixels, 20:9 ratio (~440 ppi density)\\nProtection\\nCorning Gorilla Glass 7i\\nPERFORMANCE\\nOS\\nAndroid 15, up to 2 major Android upgrades, XOS 15\\nChipset\\nMediatek Dimensity 8350 Ultimate (4 nm)\\nCPU\\nOcta-core (1x3.35 GHz Cortex-A715 & 3x3.20 GHz Cortex-A715 & 4x2.20 GHz Cortex-A510)\\nGPU\\nMali G615-MC6\\nMEMORY\\nCard Slot\\nNo\\nInternal\\n256GB 8GB RAM UFS 4.0\\nBACK CAMERA\\nDual\\n108 MP, f/1.9, (wide), PDAF 8 MP, f/2.2, 111˚ (ultrawide), AF\\nFeatures\\nDual-LED flash, HDR, panorama\\nVideo\\n4K@30/60fps, 1080p@30/60/120/240fps\\nFRONT CAMERA\\nSingle\\n13 MP, f/2.2, (wide)\\nVideo\\n4K@30fps, 1080p@30fps\\nSOUND\\nLoudspeaker\\nYes, with stereo speakers\\n3.5mm jack\\nNo Tuned by JBL 24-bit/192kHz Hi-Res & Hi-Res Wireless audio\\nCONNECTIVITY\\nWLAN\\nWi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/6, dual-band, Wi-Fi Direct\\nBluetooth\\n5.4, A2DP, LE\\nPositioning\\nGPS, GLONASS, GALILEO\\nNFC\\nYes\\nInfrared port\\nYes\\nRadio\\nFM radio\\nUSB\\nUSB Type-C 2.0, OTG\\nFEATURES\\nSensors\\nFingerprint (under display, optical), accelerometer, proximity, compass, gyro\\nBATTERY\\nType\\n5,500 mAh (5,200 mAh in some regions)\\nCharging\\n5W wired 30W wireless 10W reverse wired 5W reverse wireless Bypass Charging 2\\nNETWORK\\nTechnology\\nGSM / HSPA / LTE / 5G\\n2G bands\\nGSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900\\n3G bands\\nHSDPA 850 / 900 / 1700(AWS) / 1900 / 2100\\n4G bands\\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 17, 20, 28, 38, 40, 41, 42, 66\\n5G bands\\n1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 12, 20, 28, 38, 40, 41, 66, 71, 77, 78 SA/NSA/Sub6\\nSpeed\\nHSPA, LTE, 5G  \\nURL: https://hukut.com/infinix-gt-30-pro  \\n-----End of Product-----'),\n",

It is powered by the Snapdragon 6 Gen 4 processor paired with up to 12GB of RAM and 512GB of internal storage. The phone includes a 50MP main camera with OIS and a 16MP front-facing camera, both capable of recording in 1080p or higher. It runs on Android 15 with Realme UI 6.0 and houses a 6000mAh battery that supports 45W wired charging.  \\n### Performance  \\nUnder the hood, the Realme 14 packs Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 6 Gen 4 chip, and for a midrange phone, it’s smooth like, genuinely smooth. App switching, gaming, even light video editing doesn’t feel sluggish. And the Adreno 810 GPU? It holds its own surprisingly well in graphics-heavy tasks. Android 15 with Realme UI 6.0 is clean, responsive, and doesn’t feel bloated.\\nWhether you pick the 8GB or 12GB RAM model, paired with up to 512GB of internal storage, there’s zero compromise in day-to-day use. No microSD card, but honestly, you’re unlikely to run out of room.  \\n### Battery  \\nHere’s the part that stands out: 6000mAh battery. This thing is a tank. Two full days on moderate use isn’t a stretch. And when you do need to juice up, 45W fast charging brings it back to life quickly 50% in just 30 minutes. Plus, there’s bypass charging for when you\\'re gaming and want to avoid battery heat. Smart stuff.  \\n### Display  \\nThe 6.67-inch AMOLED display is crisp, fluid, and bright enough to fight off direct sunlight, peaking at 2000 nits. Scrolling and gaming benefit from the 120Hz refresh rate, which makes the whole experience feel more premium than the price suggests.  \\n### Camera  \\nRealme didn’t overcomplicate things here. You get a single 50MP main camera with OIS and PDAF, and it shoots sharp photos that are surprisingly stable—even in low light. Video goes up to 4K@30fps, with electronic stabilization keeping things steady. The 16MP front cam handles selfies just fine, with some pleasant HDR tuning that doesn’t go overboard.  \\n### Audio & Connectivity  \\nStereo speakers? Check. No headphone jack, sadly, but wireless audio works well with Bluetooth 5.2. The phone supports Wi-Fi 6, so no issues with fast networks. GPS performance is reliable thanks to multiple satellite systems onboard. NFC is missing, which might be a dealbreaker for contactless payment fans.  \\n### Design & Build  \\nAt 196g, the Realme 14 feels substantial but not heavy. The 8mm slim profile makes it easy to hold, and while the design isn’t revolutionary, the Silver, Titanium, and Pink options give it some personality. Realme kept it clean no huge logos or odd camera bumps.\\nRealme 14 5G Price in Nepal\\nVariant\\nPrice\\n12/256GB | Rs. 49,999  \\n###  \\nSpecifications\\nBODY\\nDimension\\n163.1 x 75.7 x 8 mm (6.42 x 2.98 x 0.31 in)\\nWeight\\n196 g (6.91 oz)\\nBuild\\nIP68/IP69 dust tight and water resistant (high pressure water jets; immersible up to 2.5m for 30 min)\\nColors\\nMecha Silver, Storm Titanium, Warrior Pink\\nDISPLAY\\nType\\nAMOLED, 120Hz, 2000 nits (peak)\\nSize\\n6.67 inches, 107.4 cm2 (~87.0% screen-to-body ratio)\\nResolution\\n1080 x 2400 pixels, 20:9 ratio (~395 ppi density)\\nPERFORMANCE\\nOS\\nAndroid 15, Realme UI 6.0\\nChipset\\nQualcomm Snapdragon 6 Gen 4 (4 nm)\\nCPU\\nOcta-core (1x2.3 GHz Cortex-A720s & 3x2.2 GHz Cortex-A720s & 4x1.8 GHz Cortex-A520s)\\nGPU\\nAdreno 810\\nMEMORY\\nCard Slot\\nNo\\nInternal\\n256GB 12GB RAM\\nBACK CAMERA\\nSingle\\n50 MP, f/1.8, 27mm (wide), PDAF, OIS\\nFeatures\\nLED flash, HDR, panorama\\nVideo\\n4K@30fps, 1080p@30/60/120fps, gyro-EIS, OIS\\nFRONT CAMERA\\nSingle\\n16 MP, f/2.4, 24mm (wide), 1/3.0\"\\nFeatures\\nPanorama\\nVideo\\n1080p@30fps\\nSOUND\\nLoudspeaker\\nYes, with stereo speakers\\n3.5mm jack\\nNo\\nCONNECTIVITY\\nWLAN\\nWi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/6, dual-band\\nBluetooth\\n5.2, A2DP, LE\\nPositioning\\nGPS, GLONASS, GALILEO, BDS, QZSS\\nNFC\\nNo\\nUSB\\nUSB Type-C\\nBATTERY\\nType\\nSi/C Li-Ion 6000 mAh\\nCharging\\n45W wired, 50% in 30 min Bypass charging\\nFEATURES\\nSensors\\nFingerprint (under display, optical), accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass\\nNETWORK\\nTechnology\\nGSM / HSPA / LTE / 5G\\n2G bands\\nGSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900\\n3G bands\\nHSDPA 800 / 850 / 900 / 1700(AWS) / 1900 / 2100\\n4G bands\\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 26, 28, 38, 40, 41, 66\\n5G bands\\n1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 20, 26, 28, 38, 40, 41, 66, 77, 78 SA/NSA\\nSpeed\\nHSPA, LTE, 5G  \\nURL: https://hukut.com/realme-14-5g  \\n-----End of Product-----'),\n",

But Samsung has made some design changes with the A54, drawing cues from the flagship S23 series. As a result, the smartphone looks quite identical to the vanilla S23, both from the front and the back with a glass back.\\nIt is available in three shades: Awesome Violet, Awesome Lime, and Awesome Graphite. The smartphone also bags an IP67 certification for protection against dust and water.\\nMoreover, the Galaxy A54 features a 6.4″ screen with a centered punch hole. It’s a Super AMOLED display with Full HD+ resolution, protected by Gorilla Glass 5. And you get 120Hz of refresh rate while the peak brightness is rated at 1000 nits.  \\n### Camera  \\nMoving on to the cameras, while the older A52 and A53 both had a 64MP primary lens, Samsung is changing things up for the Galaxy A54 which now sports a 50MP primary camera with OIS. It is followed by 12MP ultrawide and 5MP macro units. It has a 32MP selfie snapper on the front. Samsung has also provided Nightography for low-light imageries.  \\n### Performance  \\nUnder the hood, the device packs the newly-announced Exynos 1380 5G processor. Based on the 5nm process, this SoC has four Cortex-A78 (@2.4 GHz) and four Cortex-A55 (@2.0 GHz) cores. Similarly, the Mali G68 MP5 GPU is there for the graphics.\\nLooking at the core architecture, the Exynos 1380 should deliver the same performance as the Snapdragon 778G chipset. As for the software, it boots on the latest One UI 5.1 based on Android 13. The company has pledged to provide 4 years of major OS updates with 5 years of security patch updates on the Galaxy A54.  \\n### Rest of the specs  \\nFurthermore, a 5000mAh battery powers the phone, whereas the charging speed is still capped at 25W.

It comes in three attractive color options in Nepal with Desert Gold, Tidal Blue, and Midnight Black. The camera module is the same as the Pro, but the phone has a flat middle frame instead of a curved one. For protection, it features an IP66 rating, so it’s resistant to dust and water splashes, great for everyday use in unpredictable weather. The front side is dominated by a 6.55-inch AMOLED curved screen, which offers a sharp resolution of 2736 x 1264 pixels. The display supports 120Hz refresh rate, HDR10, and 3840Hz PWM dimming, making it smooth for scrolling and safe for the eyes. There\\'s also a punch-hole cutout instead of a pill-shaped notch, giving it a cleaner look.\\n**Good Performance with Long-Term Support**\\nAt its core, the Honor 400 is powered by the Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 processor. It’s a 4nm chip that performs well for regular tasks, social media use, and light gaming. Backed by 12GB LPDDR5X RAM and 512GB UFS 4.0 storage, this phone ensures quick app launches and plenty of room for photos, videos, and apps. It runs on Android 15, layered with MagicOS 9.0, offering a clean user experience with smart AI features like language translation and writing suggestions. What’s more, Honor guarantees 6 years of software and security updates, which is a big plus for buyers in Nepal who want reliable long-term usage without needing to upgrade often.\\n**Camera and Battery to Match Your Lifestyle**\\nThe camera setup is one of the main highlights of the Honor 400. You get a 200MP main camera with OIS, perfect for detailed shots, and a 12MP ultrawide sensor that can also take close-up macro photos. While it doesn’t include a telephoto lens, the front has a solid 50MP selfie camera for clear video calls and selfies. Fueling all this is a 6000mAh silicon-carbon battery, which easily lasts more than a day. Charging is fast too, with support for 80W wired and wireless SuperCharge. Other features include WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.4, eSIM, USB-C, and an in-display fingerprint scanner, making the Honor 400 a balanced mid-range option for users in Nepal.\\nHonor 400 Price in Nepal\\nVariant\\nPrice\\n12/512GB | Rs. 67,999  \\n###  \\nSpecifications\\nBODY\\nDimension\\n156.5 x 74.6 x 7.3 mm (6.16 x 2.94 x 0.29 in)\\nWeight\\n184 g\\nSIM\\nNano-SIM + Nano-SIM + eSIM (max 2 at a time) Nano-SIM + eSIM IP65 dust tight and water resistant (low pressure water jets) IP66 dust tight and water resistant (high pressure water jets) \\\\* market/region dependent availability\\nColors\\nTidal Blue, Desert Gold, Midnight Black\\nDISPLAY\\nType\\nAMOLED, 1B colors, 120Hz, 3840Hz PWM, HDR, 5000 nits (peak)\\nSize\\n6.55 inches, 105.4 cm2 (~90.3% screen-to-body ratio)\\nResolution\\n1264 x 2736 pixels, 19.5:9 ratio (~460 ppi density)\\nPERFORMANCE\\nOS\\nAndroid 15, up to 6 major Android upgrades, MagicOS 9\\nChipset\\nQualcomm SM7550-AB Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 (4 nm)\\nCPU\\nOcta-core (1x2.63 GHz Cortex-A715 & 3x2.4 GHz Cortex-A715 & 4x1.8 GHz Cortex-A510)\\nGPU\\nAdreno 720\\nMEMORY\\nCard Slot\\nNo\\nInternal\\n12/512GB\\nBACK CAMERA\\nDual\\n200 MP, f/1.9, (wide), 1/1.4\", PDAF, OIS 12 MP, f/2.2, 112˚ (ultrawide), AF\\nFeatures\\nLED flash, HDR, panorama\\nVideo\\n4K, 1080p, gyro-EIS, OIS\\nFRONT CAMERA\\nDual\\n50 MP, f/2.0, (wide)\\nFeatures\\nHDR\\nVideo\\n4K, 1080p, gyro-EIS\\nSOUND\\nLoudspeaker\\nYes, with stereo speakers\\n3.5mm jack\\nNo\\nCONNECTIVITY\\nWLAN\\nWi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/6, dual-band, Wi-Fi Direct\\nBluetooth\\n5.4, A2DP, LE, aptX HD\\nPositioning\\nGPS, GALILEO, GLONASS, QZSS, BDS\\nNFC\\nYes\\nInfrared port\\nYes\\nRadio\\nNo\\nUSB\\nUSB Type-C 2.0, OTG\\nFEATURES\\nSensors\\nFingerprint (under display, optical), accelerometer, compass, proximity (ultrasonic)\\nBATTERY\\nType\\n6000mAh silicon-carbon cell\\nCharging\\n80W wired SuperCharge, 80W wireless, 5Wreverse charging\\nNETWORK\\nTechnology\\nGSM / HSPA / LTE / 5G\\n2G bands\\nGSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900\\n3G bands\\nHSDPA 800 / 850 / 900 / 1700(AWS) / 1900 / 2100\\n4G bands\\nLTE\\n5G bands\\nSA/NSA\\nSpeed\\nHSPA, LTE, 5G  \\nURL: https://hukut.com/honor-400  \\n-----End of Product-----'),\n",

The main camera is Sony’s LYT 808 with OIS, the 3x periscope is the LYT 600 (also with OIS), and the ultrawide is Samsung’s JN5 sensor. The front-facing 32MP camera carries over from the OnePlus 12, featuring a 1/2.74” sensor with an f/2.4 aperture. The device also introduces a Silicon Carbide battery, allowing for a larger 6000mAh cell in a similar footprint. This results in an 11% increase in battery capacity compared to the OnePlus 12. Despite the larger battery, charging speeds remain impressive, with 100W wired, 50W wireless, and 10W reverse wireless charging. The phone can reach 50% in just 13 minutes and 100% in 36 minutes.\\nOnePlus 13 Price in Nepal\\nVariant\\nPrice\\n16/512GB | Rs. 1,41,999\\n16/512GB | Rs. 1,41,999  \\n###  \\nSpecifications\\nBODY\\nDimension\\n162.9 x 76.5 x 8.5 mm or 8.9 mm\\nWeight\\n213 g\\nBuild\\nGlass front (Ceramic Guard), glass back or silicone polymer back (eco leather), aluminum frame\\nSIM\\nNano-SIM + Nano-SIM + eSIM (max 2 at a time) Nano-SIM + Nano-SIM IP68/IP69 dust/water resistant (up to 1.5m for 30 min)\\nDISPLAY\\nType\\nLTPO 4.1 AMOLED, 1B colors, 120Hz, Dolby Vision, HDR10+, HDR Vivid, 800 nits (typ), 1600 nits (HBM), 4500 nits (peak)\\nSize\\n6.82 inches, 113.0 cm2 (~90.7% screen-to-body ratio)\\nResolution\\n1440 x 3168 pixels (~510 ppi density)\\nProtection\\nCeramic Guard glass Always-on display Ultra HDR image support\\nMEMORY\\nInternal\\n512GB 16GB RAM UFS 4.0\\nCard Slot\\nNo\\nPERFORMANCE\\nOS\\nAndroid 15, up to 4 major Android upgrades, OxygenOS 15\\nChipset\\nQualcomm SM8750-AB Snapdragon 8 Elite (3 nm)\\nCPU\\nOcta-core (2x4.32 GHz Oryon V2 Phoenix L + 6x3.53 GHz Oryon V2 Phoenix M)\\nGPU\\nAdreno 830\\nBACK CAMERA\\nTriple\\n50 MP, f/1.6, 23mm (wide), 1/1.43\", 1.12µm, multi-directional PDAF, OIS 50 MP, f/2.6, 73mm (periscope telephoto), 1/1.95\", 0.8µm, 3x optical zoom, PDAF, OIS 50 MP, f/2.0, 15mm, 120˚ (ultrawide), 1/2.75\", 0.64µm, PDAF\\nFeatures\\nLaser focus, Hasselblad Color Calibration, color spectrum sensor, Dual-LED flash, HDR, panorama\\nVideo\\n8K@30fps, 4K@30/60fps, 1080p@30/60/240/480fps, Auto HDR, gyro-EIS, Dolby Vision\\nFRONT CAMERA\\nSingle\\n32 MP, f/2.4, 21mm (wide), 1/2.74\", 0.8µm\\nFeatures\\nHDR, panorama\\nVideo\\n4K@30/60fps, 1080p@30/60fps, gyro-EIS\\nSOUND\\nLoudspeaker\\nYes, with stereo speakers\\n3.5mm jack\\nNo 24-bit/192kHz Hi-Res audio\\nCONNECTIVITY\\nWLAN\\nWi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/6/7, dual or tri-band, Wi-Fi Direct\\nBluetooth\\n5.4, A2DP, LE, aptX HD, LHDC 5\\nPositioning\\nGPS (L1+L5), GLONASS (G1), BDS (B1I+B1c+B2a), GALILEO (E1+E5a), QZSS (L1+L5), NavIC\\nNFC\\nYes, eSE, HCE\\nInfrared port\\nYes\\nRadio\\nNo\\nUSB\\nUSB Type-C 3.2, OTG\\nFEATURES\\nSensors\\nFingerprint (under display, ultrasonic), accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, barometer Circle to Search\\nBATTERY\\nType\\nSi/C Li-Ion 6000 mAh\\nCharging\\n100W wired, PD, QC, 50% in 13 min, 100% in 36 min 50W wireless 10W reverse wireless 5W reverse wired\\nNETWORK\\nTechnology\\nGSM / HSPA / LTE / 5G\\n2G bands\\nGSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900\\n3G bands\\nHSDPA 800 / 850 / 900 / 1700(AWS) / 1900 / 2100 - International\\n4G bands\\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 28, 30, 32, 38, 39, 40, 41, 48, 66, 71 - International\\nSpeed\\n1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 12, 20, 25, 28, 30, 38, 40, 41, 48, 66, 71, 75, 77, 78 SA/NSA/Sub6 - International\\n5G bands\\nHSPA, LTE (CA), 5G  \\nURL: https://hukut.com/oneplus-13  \\n-----End of Product-----'),\n",

It is available in four color options: Cosmos Black, and Titanium Grey. In terms of ingress protection, it secures both IP68 + IP69 ratings against dust and water damage.\\nUpfront, the curved screen has bid a farewell but not completely, if you take a closer look. The Vivo X200 Pro now sports a flat display with lightly curved edges on all four corners, like on the Xiaomi 14 Pro. It is a 6.78-inch AMOLED panel with 2K resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate.  \\n### Zeiss coated cameras  \\nThe star of the show to no one’s surprise, the mighty Zeiss cameras here backed up by Vivo’s custom V3+ imaging chip on the Vivo X200 Pro. And the most interesting among the pack is the Zeiss 200MP APO Super Telephoto lens with a 1/1.4-inch sensor size and Zeiss’s superior chromatic control, ensuring superb clarity and accurate colors. It now offers up to 135mm portraits which is like a 5.5X zoom. At the same time, the optical zoom quality is 3.7X (85mm).\\nLikewise, the main camera is a 1/1.28-inch 50MP Sony LYT-818 sensor with Vivo’s self-developed blueprint sensor technology, improving ghosting and stray light effects to form a realistic output. Lastly, there is a 50MP ultrawide unit with Autofocus and 119˚FoV and a 32MP selfie snapper. Moreover, the Vivo X200 Pro can capture up to 8K res videos at 30fps from the rear camera and up to 4K 60fps videos from the front camera.  \\n### 3nm Processor  \\nPowering the core is a Mediatek Dimesnity 9400 processor, a 3nm fabbed flagship chip. It features a core Cortex-X925 at 3.63GHz, three Cortex-X4 cores at 3.3 GHz, and four Cortex-A720 cores at 2.4GHz. Meanwhile, the Immortalis-G925 GPU handles the graphics. Vivo has paired the chip with up to 16GB of RAM and 1TB of UFS 4.0 storage. Likewise, the Vivo X200 Pro boots on OriginOS 5.0 built on top of Android 15.  \\n### Battery and Others  \\nMoving on, the Vivo X200 Pro gets its juice from a sizeable 6000mAh high-density Silicon Carbon battery with 90W wired fast charging support, 30W wireless, and reverse wired charging support.

There isn’t much going on over here, it has a large centre-aligned camera island. It is IP54-rated and is available in three outlooks: Orbit Black, Orbit White, and Magic Skin 3.0. The former has a monotone finish, while the middle option has a bit of gradient to it. The latter choice stands out the most, as it has vegan leather for its back panel.\\nThe display is also a standard game. It has a 6.67-inch screen, however, the panel type has not been specified by the company. It is likely an LCD, as it is the most sensible option. Regardless, the Tecno Spark 30C offers you an HD+ resolution and a smooth refresh rate of 120Hz. It also supports touch inputs even when the screen has water or oil on it.  \\n### Performance  \\nUnder the helm is the MediaTek Helio G81 chipset, which launched near the end of August. Even though it has been a while since it was launched, MediaTek still has not listed it on its website. This is why, we are taking Nanoreview as a reference for the information on the SoC. As per them, the silicon comes with eight cores, 12nm fabrication, and a peal clock speed of 2.0GHz. While the Redmi 14C did feature the Helio G81 Ultra, the Tecno Spark 30C is likely the first phone to have the standard version.\\nThis smartphone comes in three memory choices: 4GB, 6GB, and 8GB. Meanwhile, you can choose between 128GB and 256GB for the internal storage. Altogether, the Tecno Spark 30C is available in four configurations: 4GB + 128GB, 4GB + 256GB, 6GB + 128GB, and 8GB + 256GB. Users can virtually double the memory on this thing, however, it appears there is no option for storage expansion. Talking of the software, this phone boots on Android 14.  \\n### Camera and the rest  \\nIn terms of the camera, you get a primary 50MP unit at the back. It is assisted by a dummy lens, making it look like a dual-camera setup. However, that is definitely not the case. Likewise, it has a decent 8MP shooter on the front. In the tank, Tecno Spark 30C packs a 5,000mAh battery with 18W fast charging support. It has a stereo speaker setup with DTS tuning and apparently can deliver up to 300% louder volume.
